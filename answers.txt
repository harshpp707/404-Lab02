1. In python we specify a TCP socket wherever you create or connect socket connection, you define it in function itself. The argument would be socket.SOCK_STREAM.

2. A client is the one who creates connection and server is the one who responds to the requests by client.

3. We can use this in python command to reuse same bind port: socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM).setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

4. We get the IP address of client and port of request about the incoming connections.

5. The recv() method from a server socket will return the data sent by the client as part of an HTTP request. Where the data will be a byte object form.
